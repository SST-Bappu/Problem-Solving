A string is almost palindrome if it can be converted into a palindrome string by changin only one character.

Input = "Race a car"
Output  = True

It'll return true because if we can delete the charater 'a' then the string will be "rececar"
(regardless of spaces and special character) which is a Palindrome String. 

Input = "Race a F car"
Output = False

Here only changin a character we can't convert it to a palindrome string, that's why in that case it'll return False.
